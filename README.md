# AI Compliance-by-Design Framework for Healthcare Systems

## Overview

This repository documents a compliance-by-design framework for AI-driven
healthcare systems operating in regulated environments. The framework
provides a system-level reference architecture illustrating how governance,
auditability, and accountability mechanisms can be embedded directly into
the design of analytics-enabled and AI-supported healthcare platforms.

Rather than addressing compliance as a post-deployment activity, this
framework demonstrates how regulatory and institutional constraints may be
considered at the architecture and decision-logic levels, including data
governance, human-in-the-loop decision workflows, audit trail design, and
model risk management.

## Scope and Purpose

The materials presented in this repository are intended to support system
architects, business and systems analysts, healthcare IT integrators, and
organizations designing or evaluating AI-enabled healthcare solutions within
regulated national environments.

This framework is jurisdiction-agnostic and focuses on architectural and
governance principles that are commonly applicable across healthcare
regulatory regimes, without reliance on specific local statutes.

## Key Focus Areas

- System architecture for AI-enabled healthcare platforms
- Decision governance and human-in-the-loop controls
- Data governance and controlled data flows
- Auditability and traceability mechanisms
- Model risk awareness and change management
- Compliance-aware deployment patterns

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — Framework documentation and architectural descriptions  
- `diagrams/` — High-level system and decision-flow diagrams  
- `templates/` — Reference templates for governance, audit, and change control  

## Intended Use

This repository is intended as a reference framework and documentation
resource. It does not represent a commercial product, medical device, or
deployable software solution. No clinical or automated decisions are
performed by the framework itself.
